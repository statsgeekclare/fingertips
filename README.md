# fingertips

Working with the FingertipsR package and Fingertips API to help me learn it

The scripts are works in progress and are not currently functional! Any ideas gratefully received.

In the profile correlation script I am currently getting the following error:

`Error in seq_len(sum(is_fun)) : argument must be coercible to non-negative integer`

I can't see where I have gone wrong!
